yarn init
yarn add express mongoose morgan body-parser
yarn add babel-core babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 --dev

write app/models/todo.js to define db schema
write app/routes/todo.js to define routing

write server.js to config the server

write utils/nlp.js to implement stop-wordssagas removing utility

start coreNLP server

use eslint to check these files
use postman to test API
use mongodb compass to visually see the db documents

use webpack to create the bundle
use webpack-dev-server to serve the client during development

write client/dist/index.html
write client/src/index.js
write client/src/routes.js

.... all those work without redux

add redux, immutable, add redux-immutable to use combineReducer
add redux-saga for async requests
add react-redux from Provider
